## Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This code book summarizes the data contained in `Summarized_Wearable_Data.txt.

### Identifiers
* __Subject:__ a unique identifier for each subject who participated in the experiment
* __Activity:__ a description of the activity the subject was undertaking at the time of the observation
